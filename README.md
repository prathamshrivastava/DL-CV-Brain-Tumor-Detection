Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning (VGG16 + Flask)

This project is a deep learning-based web application for detecting brain tumors from MRI images. It uses a **pre-trained VGG16** model fine-tuned on a custom dataset and provides a **Flask-powered web interface** for users to upload an image and receive predictions.

Classifies MRI brain scans into:
  - **Glioma**
  - **Meningioma**
  - **Pituitary**
  - **No Tumor**

Built on top of VGG16 (transfer learning)
Includes data augmentation, training history plots, and model evaluation
Simple web interface using Flask
Real-time predictions with confidence scores

Results

| Class       | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Glioma      | 0.99      | 0.99   | 0.99     |
| Meningioma  | 0.91      | 0.89   | 0.90     |
| Pituitary   | 0.91      | 0.99   | 0.94     |
| No Tumor    | 0.95      | 0.89   | 0.92     |
| **Accuracy**|           |        | **94%**  |


Dataset Used
MRI images of brain tumors and healthy subjects were used from the Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset).

Future Improvements
-Improve UI styling and responsiveness
-Add support for multiple image uploads
-Deploy using Docker / on cloud (e.g., Render, Heroku, etc.)
-Model ensembling or upgrade to EfficientNet
